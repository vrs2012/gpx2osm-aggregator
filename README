gpx2osm-aggregator

This is utility script that converts gpx files into (more) usable OSM way file. 

Purpose is to make easier to draw OSM map data when you have lot 
of gpx data to play with.
Without such script you would open gpx tracks in JOSM and manually 
build new way by clicking approximately on centre of many gpx tracks.

This output probably saves some of clicking. 

Expected workflow is:
- get gpx data for area
- create .osm file
- load both gpx and osm data into JOSM
- download actual osm data into "working layer".
- is osm file manually clean/verify data. copy good roads to "working layer".
- connect new roads to existing in the working layer. 
- add refs, names etc
- upload


Practical usability:
- script technically works. 
- practical result depends on quality of gpx files:
    - clean files, where there are 5..100 tracks run a road in empty space
      will probably be converted identical to what a pedantic human operator would do.
      (curves, straights). 
    - T and X intersections, if data is not too noisy will be 80% correct.
      some intersections (sharp angles, standing still at traffic lights, noisy
      data etc) will need human to check and delete incorrect shortcuts. 
    - noisy files, where there is combination of good signal with noise 
      (i.e. parking lot, with visible often-used paths on top of hairy mess)
      these are hardest. Resulting osm will probably contain lot of garbage
      ways and will need heavy modification from user. 
- speed should not be an issue. 1m of tracks take seconds (10?) to process.

Running script:
- launch in command line (python gpx2osm.py -in==my.gpx)
